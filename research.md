## PhD thesis

My PhD thesis titled *Spatial Econometrics and the Lasso Estimator:
Theory and Applications* explores the linkages between spatial analysis 
and the Lasso estimator, a well-established regularisation technique.

The thesis is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6M60b19bJKia01IN1BwU0VscUk/view).

## Software

Jointly with Mark E Schaffer and Christian B Hansen, I have developed two Stata packages for regularized regression in Stata named *lassopack* and *pdslasso*. The packages include features intended for prediction, model selection and causal inference.
