## Welcome

Welcome my website. I am currently working as a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the 
[Economic and Social Research Institute](https://www.esri.ie) in Dublin, Ireland. Before that, 
I worked as a Research Associate at the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, UK, where I also completed my PhD in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, I was involved in BP's [*Statistical Review of World Energy*](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html), which is a well-established, publicly available resource for energy data.
