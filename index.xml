      <description>body{ font-size: 14pt; line-height:1.3; }  Policy Reports     Wirkungsevaluation der Stellenmeldepflicht
With Rafael Lalive, Patrick Arni, Tobias Lehmann, Dominik Hangartner, Joëlle Pianzola, 2021.
Abtract This report presents the conclusions of a study on the effects of the job vacancy notice obligation (JVNO) on the labour market and immigration. The study covers the JVNO with an 8% unemployment level threshold from July 2018 to December 2019. The impact is measured using the statistical methods of difference-in-differences (DID) analysis and regression discontinuity design (RDD) on register data (specifically the AVAM employment and labour market statistics system, the ASAL unemployment insurance payment system and the ZEMIS central migration information system).</description>

      <description>body{ font-size: 14pt; line-height:1.4; }  Stata Programs       The package lassopack implements lasso ( Tibshirani 1996), square-root lasso ( Belloni et al. 2011), elastic net ( Zou &amp;amp; Hastie 2005), ridge regression ( Hoerl &amp;amp; Kennard 1970), adaptive lasso ( Zou 2006) and post-estimation OLS. lassopack also supports logistic lasso.
  pdslasso offers methods to facilitate causal inference in structural models. The package allows to select control variables and/or instruments from a large set of variables in a setting where the researcher is interested in estimating the causal impact of one or more (possibly endogenous) causal variables of interest.</description>
